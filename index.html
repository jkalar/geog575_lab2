        <h1>Voter Turnout by State 2018-2000</h1>
        <p>Hopefully i can finish this damn assignment over the weekend so I do not have to waste any PTO by having to take off another day or two to finish this sumbitch of a lab.  But, knowing how things go, i'll probably be working on this until Tuesday night, 11:59PM.</p>
